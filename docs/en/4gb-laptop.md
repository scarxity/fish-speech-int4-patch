# Running S2-Pro on a 4 GB GPU

Deployment guide for the `server-4gb` profile, tuned for an RTX 3050 Laptop
(4 GB). Measured on a simulated 4096 MiB budget:

```
peak reserved : 3294 MiB of 4096 MiB   (3462 MiB on a 44 s utterance)
latency fit   : wall = 0.53s + 0.622 * audio_duration
RTF           : short 0.89  medium 0.68  long 0.66   (steady-state)
```

The stock configuration cannot load at this budget at all — it runs out of
memory inside `.to(device)` at 3.54 GiB.

## Which checkpoint

Use the **NF4 quantized** checkpoint, `scarxity/fish-speech-s2-pro-nf4`.

Do *not* use the unquantized `s2-pro` release. It is 8.5 GB of bf16
safetensors that would have to be quantized at load: more host RAM, slower
startup, no benefit. It is only useful for future work that re-quantizes with
a different scheme (e.g. torchao int4), which is **not** needed to fit 4 GB.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your-fork> fish-speech-int4-patch
cd fish-speech-int4-patch
git checkout perf/tier0-latency-vram

# ~4.9 GB
huggingface-cli download scarxity/fish-speech-s2-pro-nf4 --local-dir checkpoints/s2-pro-nf4
```

### Voices

Copy your `references/` directory across, including any `*.tokens.pt` files.
Each voice folder needs:

```
references/<id>/sample.wav    the reference clip
references/<id>/sample.lab    its transcript
references/<id>/sample.tokens.pt   precomputed VQ codes
```

Prefer a **~10 s reference over a ~30 s one**. Reference audio is pasted into
the prompt on every request at 21.53 frames/second, so a 31.7 s clip costs 683
prompt tokens against 220 for a 10.2 s clip. That is paid in both KV cache and
prefill on every single request.

To create a voice rather than copy one, see [Adding voices](#adding-voices).

## Run

### Precompute reference tokens

Run this before the first start, and again whenever you add a voice. The 4 GB
profiles load the codec without its encoder, so they cannot turn reference
audio into VQ codes at request time — the tokens have to exist on disk.

```bash
# every voice that is missing tokens
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint uv server-4gb \
  run --no-sync python tools/precompute_references.py

# or a single voice
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint uv server-4gb \
  run --no-sync python tools/precompute_references.py --reference-id <id>
```

This is a one-off command, not a server: it loads the *full* codec itself
regardless of the profile's decode-only setting, so `server` and `server-4gb`
behave identically here. Stop the running server first — at this budget the
precompute needs the GPU to itself. See [Adding voices](#adding-voices) for
the per-clip memory numbers.

### API server

```bash
docker compose --profile server-4gb build

# only if you did not copy the .tokens.pt files across
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint uv server-4gb \
  run --no-sync python tools/precompute_references.py

docker compose --profile server-4gb up -d
```

First start takes roughly 4–5 minutes (weight load, `torch.compile`, warm-up).
`/v1/health` returns 200 only once the model is ready, so it doubles as a
readiness probe.

### WebUI

```bash
docker compose --profile webui-4gb build
docker compose --profile webui-4gb up -d
```

Measured peak 3.18 GB. Roughly 5 minutes to start, of which ~116 s is
`torch.compile` — paid once at startup rather than on the first request.

**Run one or the other, never both.** Each profile loads its own copy of the
model, so two will not fit on a 4 GB card:

```bash
docker compose --profile server-4gb down
docker compose --profile webui-4gb up -d
```

Uploading reference audio through the WebUI does **not** work in this mode: the
codec has no encoder. Only voices already under `references/` with precomputed
tokens are selectable. See [Adding voices](#adding-voices).

## Network access

Both services bind `0.0.0.0` inside the container and Docker publishes on all
host interfaces.

| Service | Port | URL |
|---|---|---|
| API server | 8880 | `http://<host-ip>:8880/v1/tts` |
| WebUI | 7860 | `http://<host-ip>:7860` |

On Windows, add a firewall rule from an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "fish-speech" -Direction Inbound `
  -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8880,7860 -Action Allow
```

**This server has no authentication.** Reach it over Tailscale or another
private network rather than exposing the port to an untrusted LAN. For a remote
client, use the host's Tailscale address (`tailscale ip -4`), not its LAN IP.

## Adding voices

Reference encoding needs the codec encoder, which the 4 GB profiles do not
load. `tools/precompute_references.py` loads the full codec itself and no
language model, so it still runs on a 4 GB card — but its activations scale
with clip length:

| clip | peak |
|---|---|
| 10.2 s | 2254 MiB |
| 31.7 s | 3670 MiB — 26 MiB under the cap |

So on a 4 GB card, **keep reference clips to about 10 seconds**. That is the
right choice anyway: a 31.7 s clip costs 683 prompt tokens on every request
against 220 for a 10.2 s one.

To add a voice:

```bash
# references/<id>/sample.wav + references/<id>/sample.lab
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint uv server-4gb \
  run --no-sync python tools/precompute_references.py --reference-id <id>
```

Stop the running server first — precompute needs the GPU to itself at this
budget. For longer clips, precompute on a larger GPU and copy the resulting
`sample.tokens.pt` across.

## Long text

Codec decode activations scale with utterance length, because the decoder stack
expands to 44.1 kHz — unchunked, a 13.8 s decode peaks at 3648 MiB and OOMs.
The 4 GB profiles therefore decode the codec's conv stack in 64-frame (~3 s)
chunks (`FISH_DECODE_CHUNK_FRAMES=64`): each chunk carries 32 frames of left
context that is cropped from the output, which is *exact* — causal convolutions
have a finite receptive field (measured: 10 frames), so beyond it the chunk
boundary has zero influence. Verified against single-pass decode down to the
float64 rounding floor (~295 dB SNR); in serving precision the chunked output
is as close to an fp32 reference as the unchunked one.

**For anything longer than a couple of sentences, send:**

```json
{
  "text": "...",
  "reference_id": "beatrice10",
  "max_new_tokens": 512
}
```

`chunk_length` can stay at its default of 200. Measured on a 578-character,
five-paragraph input under the 4096 MiB budget:

| `chunk_length` | wall | audio | RTF | peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **200 (default)** | **24.3 s** | **38.1 s** | **0.64** | **3440 MiB** |
| 100 | 28.5 s | 39.7 s | 0.72 | 3462 MiB |
| 300 | 22.7 s | 43.7 s | 0.52 | 3462 MiB |
| 200, chunked decode off | 21.0 s | 38.1 s | 0.55 | 3700 MiB — 4 MiB under the cap |

The last row is why chunking is on by default: without it the same request
only survives by luck, and a real card driving a display does not have that
luck. The ~15% wall-time cost on long utterances is the overlap recompute.
Before chunked decode existed, this text OOM'd at `chunk_length` 200 and the
only working configuration was `chunk_length: 100` at RTF 1.13 — both the OOM
and the above-realtime RTF are gone.

### Why `max_new_tokens` and not `max_seq_len`

The prompt budget is `max_seq_len - max_new_tokens`. When that budget is too
small the request fails with `Prompt is too long: N > M`.

Raise the budget by **lowering `max_new_tokens`**, not by raising
`max_seq_len`. Both the KV cache and the `torch.compile` workspace scale with
`max_seq_len`, so raising it costs more memory than it buys:

| `max_seq_len` / `max_new_tokens` | load peak | result |
|---|---|---|
| 2048 / 1024 | 3030 MiB | prompt budget 1024 — too small at 4 batches |
| 4096 / 1024 | 3372 MiB | OOM during generation |
| 3072 / 512 | 3190 MiB | OOM during generation |
| **2048 / 512** | **3030 MiB** | **works** |

`max_new_tokens: 512` is ample per batch: a 100-byte batch is roughly 5 s of
speech, about 110 frames.

### The remaining ceiling

Each batch is generated with the previous batch's codes in context, so **the
prompt grows with total text length**, not with per-batch length. There is
therefore a limit on how much text one request can synthesize regardless of
`chunk_length`. Around 600 characters is comfortable; beyond that, split at
paragraph boundaries client-side and issue one request per paragraph, which
starts each with a fresh context.

### Why the chunking sits below `post_module`

An earlier attempt windowed the *whole* decode, `post_module` included, and
measured 12.2 dB SNR — audibly broken. `post_module` is an 8-layer
`WindowLimitedTransformer` (`window_size: 128`); stacking 8 window-128
attention layers gives a receptive field of ~1000 frames, far more left
context than was prepended. The working design runs `post_module` in one pass
— it operates at 21.5 Hz *before* upsampling, where a 30 s utterance is ~1 MB
of activations — and chunks only the conv stack below it, whose receptive
field is genuinely finite. (The config declares transformer layers inside the
decoder too, but `DecoderBlock` constructs and discards them without adding
them to its Sequential — the running decoder is pure causal convolution.)

## What the profile changes

Every item below is waste removal — none trades audio quality.

| Change | Saves | Why it is safe |
|---|---|---|
| `lm_head` projects onto 4097 rows, not 155776 | 0.72 GiB traffic/frame | `generate_long` masks all other logits to `-inf`; they were computed and discarded |
| Embedding table in host memory | 0.72 GiB | Only prefill embeds arbitrary vocabulary; generated tokens are always semantic or `im_end` |
| Codec loaded decode-only, fp16 | 1.36 GiB | Serving calls `from_indices()`, which never touches the encoder |
| Codec mask sized from `config.block_size` | 1.0 GiB | Was hardcoded `32768²`, ignoring a declared `block_size` of 8192 |
| `max_seq_len` 2048 | 0.28 GiB | Real worst case is ~1900 tokens; 32768 was inherited from a text-LLM config |
| Codec conv stack decoded in 64-frame chunks | ~250 MiB on long utterances, and decode stops scaling with length | Overlap-crop past the convs' 10-frame receptive field is exact; verified to the float64 rounding floor |
| Weight norm folded at load (all profiles) | per-forward weight temporaries | `w = g·v/‖v‖` computed once instead of every call — bit-identical output |

Reference encoding still runs at full fp32 in `tools/precompute_references.py`,
so cloned voices are bit-identical to the stock server.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default in profile | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FISH_OFFLOAD_EMBEDDINGS` | `1` | Keep the embedding table in host memory |
| `CODEC_DECODE_ONLY` | `1` | Drop the codec encoder, cast decode path to fp16 |
| `MAX_SEQ_LEN` | `2048` | KV cache and causal mask size |
| `FISH_FULL_LM_HEAD` | unset | Set to `1` to restore the full projection (incompatible with the offload) |
| `FISH_DECODE_CHUNK_FRAMES` | `64` | Codec conv-stack chunk size in 21.5 Hz frames; `0` disables chunking |
| `FISH_DECODE_OVERLAP_FRAMES` | unset (code default 32) | Left context per chunk; exactness needs ≥ 10 |
| `FISH_FAST_STUDENT` | unset | Path to a distilled depth transformer; see below |
| `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` | `expandable_segments:True` | Reduces allocator fragmentation |
| `API_PORT` / `GRADIO_PORT` | `8880` / `7860` | Published host ports |

## Going faster: the distilled depth transformer

On a card slower than the one these numbers came from, the bottleneck stops
being memory and becomes bandwidth. An RTX 3050 Laptop measured marginal RTF
**1.10** running this exact code, against **0.57** on a 4060 Ti — the ratio
tracks the cards' memory bandwidth (192 vs 288 GB/s), so it is hardware, not
configuration. Only a smaller model moves it.

The depth transformer is the place to cut. It is 4 layers at dim 2560 (~400M
params) and runs **nine times per frame**, which makes it roughly half of all
per-frame memory traffic — to predict residual codebooks carrying timbre and
texture, not words. A student distilled from it at dim 1024 (59.3M params) does
the same job for a fraction of the traffic:

| | teacher | student |
|---|---|---|
| Marginal RTF | 0.622 | **0.532** |
| Fixed overhead | 0.53 s | **0.38 s** |
| Peak reserved | 3294 MiB | **3190 MiB** |

Point `FISH_FAST_STUDENT` at the checkpoint to enable it:

```bash
# .env, or the environment
FISH_FAST_STUDENT=checkpoints/fast-student-d1024.pt
```

Unset, the teacher's own stack serves exactly as before — the swap is opt-in and
reverts by clearing the variable. The file must exist if the variable is set;
there is no silent fallback.

Because the student replaces only the depth transformer, it cannot affect words,
pronunciation, languages, or the inline emotion tags. Those come from the slow
backbone, which is untouched.

### Training one

`tools/distill/` holds the pipeline: `build_corpus.py` writes a corpus,
`capture_teacher.py` records what the teacher's depth transformer does on it
(hidden state in, codebook indices out), `train_student.py` fits a student to
those, and `ab_student.py` renders teacher-vs-student pairs to listen to.

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **Capture must run eager.** The capture hook lives inside the compiled
  `decode_one_token_ar`, and `torch.compile` bakes "no capture" in at trace
  time. That costs ~9 tokens/s against ~33 compiled. The same mechanism means
  `ab_student.py` also generates eager, so it must not be used for timing —
  `vram_harness.py` with and without the variable is the speed measurement.
- **Watch validation KL, not agreement.** In the reference run, KL bottomed at
  step 2499 and rose for the next ten evals while top-1 agreement kept climbing
  — the student sharpening toward the teacher's argmax while drifting from the
  distribution that sampling actually draws from. The trainer checkpoints on
  KL, so `best_student.pt` is the one to ship; ~2500 steps was the useful
  length.

## If it still runs out of memory

The measurements above come from a simulated 4 GB card on a 16 GB one. Two
things that simulation cannot model: Windows' desktop compositor reserving part
of a real card, and the 3050's weaker compute.

The desktop point is the big one: a card that is also driving a display starts
400–800 MB down before anything loads, against a measured peak of ~3.2–3.5 GB.

In order of impact:

1. **Run the display off the integrated GPU** so the discrete card is dedicated
   to compute. On a laptop this is usually a BIOS setting or a per-application
   preference in the NVIDIA control panel.
2. Switch to a ~10 s reference clip if you are using a longer one.
3. Drop `FISH_DECODE_CHUNK_FRAMES` to `32`, which halves the per-chunk decode
   activations for a little more overlap recompute.
4. Drop `MAX_SEQ_LEN` to `1536` (safe with a 10 s reference).
5. Reduce `--max-new-tokens` in the request, which lowers the KV high-water
   mark.

## Verifying a change yourself

`tools/vram_harness.py` simulates a small card on a large one via
`torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction()`, so 4 GB behaviour can be tested
on a bigger GPU:

```bash
FISH_OFFLOAD_EMBEDDINGS=1 uv run --no-sync python tools/vram_harness.py \
  --bnb4 --compile --codec-decode-only --budget-mib 4096 --max-seq-len 2048
```

It reports peak reserved VRAM and a least-squares fit of wall time against
audio duration, separating fixed overhead from marginal RTF. Note that the CUDA
context lives outside the allocator cap, which is why `--context-mib` (default
400) is subtracted from the budget before computing the fraction.

For codec changes there is also `tools/verify_codec_decode.py`, which compares
chunked against single-pass decode (and folded against unfolded weights) on
real reference tokens. Use `--sections float64` for exactness — fp32 has a
~4e-6 rounding floor of its own that has nothing to do with chunking.
