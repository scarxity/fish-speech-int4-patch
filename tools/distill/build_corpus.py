"""Deterministic corpus builder for fast-transformer distillation.

Writes one JSON object per line to ``notes/distill/corpus.jsonl``:

    {"utt_id", "text", "lang", "reference_id", "temperature", "seed"}

Text is generated programmatically from per-language template banks and phrase
pools with a single seeded RNG, so the same ``--seed``/``--count`` always
produce the same corpus - the capture tool derives its per-utterance torch seed
from ``utt_id``, and reproducing a shard means reproducing the line that made
it. No network, no external corpora.

Style target is companion-bot dialogue (greetings, reactions, opinions, small
stories, questions, quoted speech, plus a formal register), not encyclopedic
prose, because that is what the deployed voice actually says.
